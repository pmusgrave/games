# TERTRIS

Tetris in the terminal. Written in Rust.

### Requirements
To play this, you'll need Rust installed. You can get Rust [here](https://rustup.rs/). 

This has been tested to work on Linux and Mac systems. It uses ncurses for display, so Windows is not supported at this time.

### Installation instructions:
```
cd tertris
cargo run
```

### Playing instructions:
```
Left/Right arrow keys to move.
Down arrow key to move down manually.
Up arrow key to drop to the bottom.
'z' to rotate piece.
F1 to quit.
Esc key to pause/unpause.
```
